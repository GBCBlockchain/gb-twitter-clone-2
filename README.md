# LECTURE 2

Added API

    - You can now interact with a restful API to create tweets or users and update them
    - Before starting the create-react-app you will need to start the fake api server by
    issuing the following command:

    ```
    npm run api
    ```

    - for documentation on what you can do with this fake api - please see [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
